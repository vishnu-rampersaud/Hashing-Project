This is a belated upload of a class project written in C++, which consists of testing three hashing implementations and then using the best one for a simple spell checker. 
This project contains three parts. 

- Read in all words from a text file and inserting them into a hash table, and then print out its statistics
- Check whether each word in another given query text file is in the hash table or not.
- implement a spell checker pand output all misspelled words and possible corrections based on assignment details
